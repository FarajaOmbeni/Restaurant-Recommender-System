# Restaurant-Recommender-System
## Introduction
This is a semester project built by Ombeni Faraja and Ian Kirema during their third year in Strathmore University in July, 2023.

* Restaurants are very intersting ways where one can spend time, discover new flavours and culture.
* This recommender system will help people experience new places and flavours.
* This Notebook contains is using a combination of Collaborative Filtering and Content-based Filtering.

## Algorithm
* The restaurant recommender system utilizes collaborative filtering, a popular algorithm for generating recommendations based on user behavior and preferences. It analyzes the ratings given by multiple users to identify similarities and recommend restaurants based on those similarities.

* The algorithm follows these steps:
* Preprocess the data by cleaning, normalizing, and transforming it as required.
* Compute similarity scores between users or restaurants using techniques such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation.
* Identify the most similar users or restaurants based on the similarity scores.
* Generate recommendations based on the preferences and ratings of similar users or restaurants.
* Present the recommendations to the user.
