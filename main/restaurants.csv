I would give it 5 Stars except for one issue, which me and my wife have experienced on rare occasion, which has forced us to just walk out. We walk into an entirely empty restaurant and we're taken to the smallest table by the door or the bathroom. Last night we went to Cremini's for the first time. No complaints with the food. Also, my wife is fluent Italian, lived in Italy, and made small talk with the owner when we walked in. He takes us to small table right by the front door and adjacent to a table with the only other 2 people in the restaurant. There was a table behind that against the wall, better situated and more comfortable with a padded bench. It was not like it was a table for 10. It was for 3 people. I asked for that table, and he said no, that was for 3 people. I looked around the restaurant. There are about 8 tables and a bar. There is one person at the bar and two at another table. I asked again but he said no, so we were hungry and stayed. Firstly in was a Monday night, about 6 PM, early for most restaurants, and probably the slowest night of the week. I am 6 ft 5 inches tall and 300 lbs, built like a football linebacker, so I am just not comfortable at a small table. Dinner was good, but during the hour or so we were there, not one other person came in to sit at any of the other empty tables. One guy came in to pick up a take out orders and since we were right by the door, he stood there for a few minutes waiting for his order, with his crotch and backside inches from where I was eating. Really not so smart on the owners part because if we would have had the more comfortable table, I would have come back to this restaurant. But there are so many good Italian restaurants just in Downtown Brooklyn and walking distance from our apartment in Dumbo, that there is no need to make the effort. We wanted to try this place, so we took our car out of the parking lot, drove there and had to drive around a bit to find a parking spot. Food is #1 in a restaurant, but being comfortable is just about as important. You go out to a nice restaurant like this for the overall experience, not just the food. Otherwise you might as well just get takeout.
